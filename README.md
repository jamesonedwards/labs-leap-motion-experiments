labs-leap-motion-experiments
============================
This project showcases some simple experiments using Leap Motion, a programmable, gesture sensing, human--computer interaction device. Each experiment expanded on the previous one:

1) Change the size of a shape based on the number of fingers detected.
2) Move a dot around with a pointing device (finger, pen, etc), and change its size based on distance from the Leap Motion's z-axis origin.
3) Draw a trail of such dots with a pointer.
4) Create a "flashlight" effect, which exposes an area of a hidden image with a pointer.
5) Create a "scratch-off ticket" effect, which exposes parts of a hidden image as the pointer is moved around.

The Leap Motion SDK is very easy to setup and develop against, and supports a number of different language bindings. I chose Java so that I could use the Processing libraries to build the graphics. The Leap Motion's tracking takes some getting used to, but all things considered, it works surprisingly well.

This is very much still a work in progress.
